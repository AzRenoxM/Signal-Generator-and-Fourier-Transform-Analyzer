Signal Generator and Fourier Transform Analyzer

This repository contains a Python class-based implementation for generating various types of waveforms and performing Fourier Transform analysis on them. The waveforms include sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, and white noise. The program provides a menu-driven interface for the user to select and manipulate the functions.
Features

    Waveform Generation: Generate sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, and white noise waveforms.
    Fourier Transform: Perform and display the Fourier Transform of the generated waveforms.
    Interactive Menu: User-friendly menu interface to choose and display different waveforms and their Fourier Transforms.
    Save Functionality: (To be implemented) Save the generated waveforms to .csv and .wav files.
